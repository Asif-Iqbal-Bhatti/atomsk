<h2>Option: dislocation</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p><code>-dislocation &#60;p<sub>1</sub>&#62; &#60;p<sub>2</sub>&#62; &#60;disloctype&#62; &#60;dislocline&#62; &#60;dislocplane&#62; &#60;b1&#62; [&#60;b2&#62; &#60;b3&#62;] &#60;&nu;&#62;</code></p>

<p><code>-disloc &#60;p<sub>1</sub>&#62; &#60;p<sub>2</sub>&#62; &#60;disloctype&#62; &#60;dislocline&#62; &#60;dislocplane&#62; &#60;b1&#62; [&#60;b2&#62; &#60;b3&#62;] &#60;&nu;&#62;</code></p>


<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This option allows to insert a straight edge or screw dislocation in the system. The equations used by this option can be found e.g. in J.P. Hirth and J. Lothe, <em>Theory of dislocations</em>.</p>

<p>The user has to provide the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub></strong>: coordinates of the dislocation in the plane normal to the dislocation line (see <code>dislocline</code>), by order of permutation X, Y, Z (e.g. if <code>dislocline=Y</code> then p<sub>1</sub> will be the position along Z and p<sub>2</sub> the position along X).</li>
  <li><strong>disloctype</strong>: type of dislocation, must be "screw", "edge", or "edge2"; when using anisotropic elasticity, can be "mixed" (see below);</li>
  <li><strong>dislocline</strong>: direction of dislocation line, must be x, y or z;</li>
  <li><strong>dislocplane</strong>: direction normal to the plane of cut, must be x, y or z, and must be different from <code>dislocline</code>;</li>
  <li><strong>b1, b2, b3</strong>: components of the Burgers vector (in &Aring;); for dislocations of type "edge", "edge2" and "screw" only one value must be given; for type "mixed" the 3 components must be provided;</li>
  <li><strong>&nu;</strong>: Poisson ratio of the material; it is very important to specify a correct value if you build an edge dislocation (for screw dislocations it is not used and can be set to any arbitrary value).</li>
</ul>

<p>The positions &#60;p<sub>1</sub>&#62; and &#60;p<sub>2</sub>&#62; are usually given in &Aring;. It is also possible to give them with respect to the box dimensions with the keyword BOX and an operation (see <a href="./box.html">this page</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Edge dislocations</strong> can be constructed in two different ways that can be selected by setting the parameter <code>disloctype</code> to "edge" or "edge2". The first method, used when the parameter <code>disloctype</code> is set to <strong>edge</strong>, consists in inserting a row of new atoms in the system, and then applying atomic displacements corresponding to the elastic field of an edge dislocation. Subsequently the supercell vector in the direction of the Burgers vector is elongated by 2/3 of the Burgers vector -it is recommended to check it afterwards. Because this method changes the total number of atoms and the volume of the supercell, the comparison between the final and initial systems is made irrelevant. With the second method, used when the parameter <code>disloctype</code> is set to <strong>edge2</strong>, the edge dislocation is constructed by conserving the total number of atoms in the system (also conserving the supercell vectors). This method results in the presence of a 
step at one edge of the supercell, possibly messing up the boundary conditions.</p>

<p>For <strong>screw dislocations</strong> the total number of atoms as well as the cell vectors are unchanged.</p>

<p>By default the dislocations are introduced using the <strong>isotropic elastic solutions</strong>, i.e. the displacements applied to the atoms are, for an edge dislocation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<code>u<sub>x1</sub> = (<em>b</em>/2&pi;) [ atan(x<sub>2</sub>/x<sub>1</sub>) + x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>/(2(1-&nu;)(x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>+x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)) ]</code> <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>u<sub>x2</sub> = (-<em>b</em>/2&pi;) [ (1-2&nu;)ln(x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>+x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>))/(4(1-&nu;)) + (x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>-x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)/(4(1-&nu;)(x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>+x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)) ]</code>
</p>

<p>and for a screw dislocation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>u<sub>x<sub>3</sub></sub> = (<em>b</em>/2&pi;) atan(x<sub>2</sub>/x<sub>1</sub>)</code></p>

<p>where x<sub>3</sub> is the direction of &#60;dislocline&#62;, and x<sub>2</sub> the normal to the plane of cut. The theoretical dislocation stresses (from the continuum theory) are also computed, however since the shear modulus &mu; is unknown the stresses are normalized to it, i.e. all stresses are calculated with &mu;=1 (in other words the quantity computed is actually &sigma;/&mu;). The six Voigt components &sigma;<sub>xx</sub>, &sigma;<sub>yy</sub>, &sigma;<sub>zz</sub>, &sigma;<sub>xy</sub>, &sigma;<sub>yz</sub> and &sigma;<sub>xz</sub> are saved as auxiliary properties for each atom. If several dislocations are introduced in the system then the corresponding theoretical stresses are summed. Note that they can be written only to some files formats, like CFG (see <a href="./formats.html">this page</a> for a list of formats that support writing of auxiliary properties).</p>

<p>The use of <strong>anisotropic elasticity</strong> is automatically triggered when the elastic tensor is defined before calling the present option, e.g. through the <a href="./option_properties.html">option <code>-properties</code></a> (see specifications of this option for details on the rotation of the elastic tensor). When using anisotropic elasticity a value of &nu; must still be given, but is not used (it can be set to zero or any arbitrary value). In addition to the dislocation types described above, a mixed dislocation can be built by setting <code>disloctype</code> to "mixed", after what the three components of the Burgers vector must be given. The equations of anisotropic elasticity are solved to determine the coefficients <em>A<sub>k</sub>(n)</em>, <em>D(n)</em>, <em>P(n)</em> and <em>B<sub>ijk</sub>(n)</em>, and the anisotropic displacements are applied:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>u<sub>k</sub> = </code>&real;{<code> (-2&pi;<em>i</em>)<sup>-1</sup> <strong>&sum;</strong><sub>(n=1,3)</sub> <em>A<sub>k</sub>(n) D(n)</em> ln(x<sub>1</sub>+<em>P(n)</em>x<sub>2</sub>) </code>}, k=1,3</code></p>

<p>These coefficients are also used to compute the theoretical dislocation stresses:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>&sigma;<sub>ij</sub> = </code>&real;{<code> (-2&pi;<em>i</em>)<sup>-1</sup> <strong>&sum;</strong><sub>(n=1,3)</sub> <em>B<sub>ijk</sub>(n) A<sub>k</sub>(n) D(n)</em> / (x<sub>1</sub>+<em>P(n)</em>x<sub>2</sub>) </code>}</p>

<p>Since the elastic tensor is known, in this case it is the exact stresses that are computed. As for the isotropic case, the Voigt components are saved as auxiliary properties for each atom, and if several dislocations are constructed then their contributions to the stresses are added.</p>

<p>Beware that <code>atomsk</code> does not "automagically" find nor adjusts the Burgers vector of the dislocation, so a very precise value of <code>b</code> must be provided. Neither does the program find the optimal position for the dislocation center: a position <code>(p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub>)</code> that exactly matches an atom position may result in unrealistic displacements, so you may have to play around with these coordinates to obtain proper results. As always, don't trust a program blindly -check your system before running any simulation, especially when building systems with dislocation(s).</p>

<p>If a selection was defined (with the <a href="./option_select.html">option <code>-select</code></a>) then the displacements described above will be applied only to selected atoms.</p>



<h4>Default</h4>

<p>By default no dislocation is introduced at all.</p>



<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -dislocation 0.5*BOX 0.5*BOX screw z y 3.2 0.0 final.xyz</code>
<p>This will read <code>initial.cfg</code> and insert a screw dislocation of Burgers vector 3.2 &Aring; lying along Z, in the middle of the box along X (because p<sub>1</sub>=0.5*BOX) and also in the middle along Y (because p<sub>2</sub>=0.5*BOX). The result will be output to <code>final.xyz</code>. Note that a value of the Poisson ratio must be provided although it is not used (it is arbitrarily set to 0.0 here)</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -disloc 0.25*BOX 0.5*BOX screw z y 3.2 0.0 -disloc 0.75*BOX 0.5*BOX screw z y -3.2 0.0 final.xyz</code>
<p>This will read <code>initial.cfg</code> and insert two screw dislocations of opposite Burgers vectors, the first one at (0.25;0.5) and the second one at (0.75;0.5). The result will be output to <code>final.xyz</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk unitcell.xyz -expand 30 2 20 -disloc 30 40.2 edge y x 2.8 0.28 dislocation.xsf</code>
<p>This will read <code>unitcell.xyz</code>, <a href="./option_expand.html">expand it</a> to form a 30x2x20 supercell, and then construct an edge dislocation by inserting a row of new atoms. The dislocation line will lie along Y, with a Burgers vector of 2.8 &Aring;, using a Poisson ratio of 0.28, and the center of the dislocation will be placed at 30 &Aring; along Z and 40.2 &Aring; along X. The result will be output to <code>dislocation.xsf</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk unitcell.xyz -expand 30 2 20 -disloc 30 40.2 edge2 y x 2.8 0.28 dislocation.cfg</code>
<p>Similar to the previous example, except that the edge dislocation will be constructued by adding a surface step  (i.e. without inserting new atoms).</p></li>

<p>Assume we want to build a dislocation in a slab of iron with crystallographic orientation X=[110], Y=[1<span class="over">1</span>0], Z=[001]. The original system (<code>initial.xyz</code>) has that orientation. In this example the <a href="./option_properties.html">option <code>-properties</code></a> is used to read the elastic tensor and the system orientation from the file <code>ctensor.txt</code>, therefore the anisotropic elasticity will be used to construct the dislocation. This is usually the most convenient way to use anisotropic elasticity for building a dislocation. Note that in the option <code>-dislocation</code> the Poisson ratio must be provided although it is not used (it is arbitrarily set to 0.0 here).</p></li>

<p>This example illustrates another way of doing the same thing as the previous example. The original system (<code>initial.xyz</code> which is oriented X=[110], Y=[1<span class="over">1</span>0], Z=[001]) is first rotated thanks to the <a href="./option_orient.html">option <code>-orient</code></a> so that the [100] crystal direction lies along X, [010] along Y and [001] along Z. Then the elastic tensor, which corresponds to that orientation, is read. Then the system is rotated back to its original orientation (this could also be done by using the <a href="./option_alignx.html">option <code>-alignx</code></a> instead), which also rotates the elastic tensor accordingly. Finally the dislocation can be introduced.</p></li>

<li><p>You may also want to look at the scripts in the "examples" folder provided with the program. The folder "<code>Al_110dislocations</code>" contains a bash script that builds two edge dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors in a slab of aluminium, using isotropic elasticity. The folder "<code>Fe_disloc_screw111_anisotropy</code>" shows how to build a 1/2&#60;111&#62; screw dislocation in iron using anisotropic elasticity.</p></li>
