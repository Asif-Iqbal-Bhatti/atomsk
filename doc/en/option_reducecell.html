<h2>Option: reduce-cell</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p><code>-reduce-cell</code></p>


<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This option reduces the system into a shorter cell, while maintaining the periodicity.</p>

<p>This option searches for pairs of equivalent atoms. If the vector joining two equivalent atoms is parallel to and shorter than an initial cell vector, then it replaces it. The box may be shortened in one, two, or in all three directions. Then, atoms that are out of the new box are removed, along with their shells and auxiliary properties if they had any.</p>

<p>This option preserves the crystal orientation, it just attempts to shorten the cell vectors when it is possible. The resulting final cell should be the shortest for this crystal orientation.</p>

<p>If the system is rotated and you wish to obtain an orthorhombic unit cell, then use the <a href="./option_orthocell">option <code>-orthogonal-cell</code></a> before this one.</p>

<p>Note that this option is meant for use with perfect crystals. It cannot be expected to give good results in crystals containing defects, nor on non-crystalline or disordered systems.</p>


<h4>Default</h4>

<p>By default Atomsk does not reduce cell vectors.</p>



<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk system.cfg -reduce-cell xsf</code>
<p>This will read the file <code>system.cfg</code> and re-calculate the supercell base vectors. The result will be output in <code>system.xsf</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -rotate Z 45 -orthogonal-cell -reduce-cell final.cfg</code>
<p>This will <a href="./option_rotate.html">rotate the system</a> by 45Â° around Z, search for an <a href="./option_orthocell.html">equivalent orthogonal cell</a>, and finally attempt to reduce the size of this cell. The result will be output in <code>final.cfg</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
